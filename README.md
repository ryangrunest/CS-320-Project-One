# My Java Application

This is a simple Java application that demonstrates the basic structure of a Java project using Maven, and JUnit for testing.

## Reflection

- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by writing comprehensive unit tests, testing all lines of code and all edge cases. I can use code reviews through Pull Requests to ensure that fewer human errors are made, as team members can catch my mistakes that I may have missed.

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Before writing the program, I can gather requirements and expectations of the software by communicating with stakeholders and program managers. From there, user stories can be created, with acceptace criteria based on these expectations using clearly defined requirements.

- How do I approach designing software?

Start by understanding the requirements, then break down the requirements into bite sized chunks. Make a plan on what architectures and frameworks you'll be using. With all the requirements understood, you can create diagrams such as UML to assist in architecting the software. After the requirements are well documented, iterate through the software development lifecycle, using agile methodologies to incrementally develop the software.
